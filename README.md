## Hi there 👋

My name is **Jiaqi Yu**, I am a master's degree student in **Computer Science and Engineering** at IST,  my major study areas are **Software Engineering** and **Artificial Intelligence**. Now I will find a job this year, hopefully! ;>

<!--- 🔭 I’m currently working on some full stack project-->
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **TypeScript** and **Swift** because I want to become a Full Stack Developer in the future and a System Engineer later on.
- 🤔 I'm looking for someone to help with a small negotiation on a project because I have an idea, and it's difficult to do it by myself.
